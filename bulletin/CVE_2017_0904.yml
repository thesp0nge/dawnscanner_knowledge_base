message: |-
 The private_address_check ruby gem before 0.4.0 is vulnerable to a bypass due to use of Ruby's Resolv.getaddresses method, which is OS-dependent and should not be relied upon for security measures, such as when used to blacklist private network addresses to prevent server-side request forgery.
